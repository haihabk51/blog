Hello, Picturerep. Can I help you?

Oh, hi. I saw your (1)____________ about copying pictures to disk and I’d like a bit more information about what you do.

Sure. What would you like to know?

Well, I’ve got a box full of old family photos that’s been up in the (2)____________ for years, some of them must be 50 or 60 years old, and I’d like to get them (3)____________ to digital format.

Sure, we can do that for you.

Right. And what about size? The photos are all sorts of sizes - are there any (4)____________?

Well the (5)____________ size of photo we can do with our normal service is 30 centimetres. And each picture must be at least 4 centimetres, that’s the minimum we can (6)____________.

That should be fine. And some of them are (7)____________ - should I take them out before I send them?

Yes please, we can’t copy them otherwise. And also the photos must all be (8)____________, they mustn’t (9)____________ an album.

OK, that’s not a problem. So can you give me an idea of how much this will cost? I’ve got about (10)____________ I think.

We **charge** £195 for 300 to 400 photos for the (11)____________.

OK. And does that include the disk?

Yes, one disk - but you can get extra ones (12)____________.

That’s good. So do I need to pay when I send you the photos?

No, we won’t need anything until we’ve actually copied the pictures. Then we’ll let you know how much it is, and once we’ve received the payment, we’ll send (13)____________ to you.

Right.

Is there anything else you’d like to ask about our services?

Yes. I’ve (14)____________ sorted out the photos into groups, according to what they’re about - so can you keep them in those groups when you copy them?

Sure. We’ll save each group in (15)____________ on the disk and if you like, you can suggest a name for each folder.

So I could have one called (16)____________ for instance?

Exactly.

And do you do anything besides scan the photos? Like, can you make any (17)____________?

Yes, in the standard service each photo is checked, and we can sometimes (18)____________ the color a bit, or improve the contrast - that can (19)__________________.

OK. And some of the photos are actually quite (20)____________ - they won’t get damaged in the process, will they?

No, if any look particularly fragile, we’d do them by hand. We do realise how (21)___________ these old photos can be.

Sure.

And another thing is we can make changes to a photo if you want - so if you want to remove an object from a photo, or maybe (22)__________________, we can do that.

Really? I might be interested in that. I’ll have a look through the photos and see.

Oh, and talking of fixing photos - I’ve got a few that aren’t properly in (23)____________. Can you do anything to make that better?

NO, I’m afraid that’s one thing we can’t do

OK

Any other information I can give you?

Er... oh, how long will it all take?

We aim to get the copying done in (24)____________

Fine. Right, well I’ll get the photos (25)____________ in a box and (26)____________ to you.

Right. If you’ve got (27)___________________, that’s best. We’ve found that plastic ones sometimes break in the post.

OK. Right, thanks for your help. Bye.

Bye
