Prosthetic Limbs
Robotic technology can also be used to make a prosthetic limb move. A prosthetic limb
is an artificial arm, hand, leg, or foot that replaces a missing one. Modern prosthetic limbs
can be controlled by electrical signals from the brain.
In the past, prosthetic hands had few fingers and could
not do many things. Today, they have a thumb and four
fingers that are controlled individually, These prosthetic
hands can turn a key, pick up small objects, and hold
a glass.
Current prosthetic legs and feet allow their users to walk
and even run. As technology advances, prosthetic legs and
feet work more like real legs and feet. The latest prosthetic
limbs also look more like real limbs.
1. How do prosthetic limbs help people?
2. How are prosthetic hands different today compared with
those of the past?
What does this man's prosthetic hand enable him to do?
